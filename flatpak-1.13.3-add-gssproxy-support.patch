Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Bind gssproxy socket into sandbox environment

We're using a directory rather than binding a socket directly for
increased robustness. In theory, if gssproxy crashes on the host, a new
socket that a new gssproxy process creates should be immediately visible
inside the sandbox. Nifty.

Previously, applications that wanted to use Kerberos authentication
would have to punch a sandbox hole for the host's KCM socket. In
contrast, this gssproxy socket is designed for use by sandboxed apps.

Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Block KRB5CCNAME from inheriting into sandbox

If this environment variable is set on the host, it's going to mess up
authentication in the sandbox. For example, if the host has:

KRB5CCNAME=KCM:

then the sandboxed process will try to use the host KCM socket, which is
not available in the sandboxed environment, rather than the gssproxy
socket that we want it to use. We need to unset it to ensure that
whatever configuration we ship in the runtime gets used instead. We have
switched the GNOME runtime to use an empty krb5.conf and it works as
long as we don't break it with this environment variable meant for the
host.
